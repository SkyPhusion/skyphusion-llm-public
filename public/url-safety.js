// URL safety for values this app did not construct.
//
// Web-search results reach the transcript carrying a `url` field that
// originates off-box. SearXNG hands upstream engine results through with a
// truthiness filter only (src/searxng.ts filters on `r.url && r.title` and
// never parses), src/routes/rag.ts maps them to source_type:"web", and the
// value is persisted in retrieved_context and replayed on every subsequent
// transcript render. So the string in an href there is not ours.
//
// WHY ESCAPING IS THE WRONG TOOL HERE. escapeHtml() replaces & < > " ' and is
// exactly right for stopping attribute injection. It does nothing whatever to
// a scheme: `javascript:alert(1)` contains none of those five characters and
// passes through escaping byte for byte. Escaping answers "can this break out
// of the attribute", and the question an href also has to answer is "what does
// this navigate to". Two different questions, two different guards, and both
// call sites keep both.
//
// PARSE, DO NOT PATTERN-MATCH. The URL parser strips leading and trailing
// C0/space, and removes embedded tab, LF and CR, before it resolves the
// scheme. So " JavaScript:x", "java\nscript:x" and "JAVASCRIPT:x" all
// normalise to protocol "javascript:" and are refused by the check below,
// while a hand-written regex sees three unrelated strings and will miss at
// least one of them. Delegating to the parser is what makes the guard
// complete rather than a list of the variants someone happened to think of.
//
// ALLOWLIST, NOT BLOCKLIST. An allowlist of the two schemes a web result can
// legitimately use cannot be outgrown; a blocklist of the dangerous ones has
// to be extended every time a browser ships a new scheme.
//
// Its own file, loaded as a classic script before app.js, the same shape
// voice-widget.js already uses for shared browser helpers. It is separate so
// that the SHIPPED function is addressable from a test: app.js touches the DOM
// at top level and cannot be evaluated outside a browser, so a guard living
// inside it could only ever be tested by a copy, and a copy is a second thing
// that drifts. tests/public-url-safety.test.ts evaluates THIS file and refuses
// to run at all if the function is missing or renamed, so the suite cannot
// pass vacuously against a guard that is no longer there.
